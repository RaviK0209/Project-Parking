# Smart Car Parking System

The Smart Car Parking System is an efficient and user-friendly web-based solution designed to manage parking space availability.
It helps allocate parking spaces dynamically and handles overflow through a queue system. 

When parking spaces are full, incoming cars are added to a queue, and as soon as a parked car vacates, the next car in the queue gets allocated the available parking spot in order. This project aims to enhance parking management and reduce user inconvenience.
